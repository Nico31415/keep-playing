# keep-playing

In this project we had to design and implement a solution to a real-world problem following the principles of agile development and human centred design. The problem solution had to involve a digital touch-point in the form of a multi-user web or mobile application and had to involve real-time user interactions to maintain a consistent internal state via use of a server side database.

Please find the presentation "DRP43 Final.pptx" for more information about our project.

This repository contains the backend part of our code, you can find the frontend part at keep-playing-frontend.
